# BITS-F464-ML
My notes, assignments and project of the course BITS F464 Machine Learning taught by Prof. Manik Gupta in Sem II 2023-24 at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus.

**Assignment - 1**

Implementation and comparison of the following algorithms on a synthetically generated diabetes dataset:

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent and Batch Gradient Descent using Linear Regression
2. Lasso and Ridge Regression using Polynomial Regression
3. Logistic Regression and Least Squares Classification

**Assignment - 2**

Implementation and comparison of the following algorithms on a law enforcement and crime dataset:

1. Decision tree model with entropy implementation
2. Adaboost
3. Multiclass SVM

**Project - Machine Learning for Sustainable Development Goals**

Implementation four ML Models to predict wildfires in the northeast region of Portugal. The algorithms chosen for the project are:

1. K-Nearest Neighbors
2. Multinomial Naive Bayes using Laplace Smoothing
3. Multilayer Perceptron
4. ExtraTrees Classifier
